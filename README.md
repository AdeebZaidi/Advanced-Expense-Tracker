# Advanced Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker App is a web-based application that allows users to input and track their daily expenses, categorize them, and view visual representations of their spending patterns. The app stores expense data locally in the browser using local storage, ensuring that the data persists even after refreshing or closing the browser. Additionally, the app includes charting features for a clear graphical overview of the user's spending by category and date.

Built using vanilla JavaScript, this app focuses on providing a simple and intuitive interface to track expenses, view historical data, and analyze spending habits with dynamic charts.
